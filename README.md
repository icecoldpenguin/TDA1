## Assignment - 1
The program `calculator.py` takes as input any two integers and computes the sum, difference, product and division of the two integers

Let the two integers be x and y

```py
x = input("First number: ")
```

```py
y = input("Second number: ")
```

The program computes:
```py
sum = x+y
diff = x-y
mult = x*y
divi = x/y
```

`printf` is used to display variable with the output text.

## Assignment - 2
The program `greetings.py` takes as input any two strings as first name and last name, and uses `printf` to display the text with the variables.

```

```py

```

```py
print(f"Hello {firstname} {lastname}! Welcome to the world of Python!")
```
